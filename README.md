REQUIRED (DELETE ONCE DONE): "Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your major findings. 
This should include a heading for each question you asked of your data and under each heading a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.

# Core hypothesis
## That Warren Buffet's suggested ETFs were not the best choice for Mrs Buffet's eventual inheritance.
### In 2013, Warren Buffett stated that he advised trustees to manage the money he will leave to his wife by allocating
### 10% in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund (suggesting Vanguardâ€™s.)
### Warren said he believed the long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors.
### We want to test Warren's suggestion against other options and criteria to determine if it is the best recommendation for Mrs Buffet.

# Key Questions to answer:
## What are the appropriate asset classes for Mrs Buffet's inheritance?
We considered asset classes including: direct shares / bonds / FX holdings, cryptocurrencies, real estate, collectables.  
But these were discounted based on our subjective criteria, and we concluded ETFs are an appropriate asset class for Mrs Buffet due to her knowledge and life stage.

## How do we select the specific assets within the appropriate asset(s) class?
Within the ETF universe, we used a funnel to output the top ETFs over different timeframes.

## What other factors do we need to consider for our final recommendation to Mrs Buffet?  
We also considered ESC (Environmental, Social, and (Corporate) Governance) ratings, risk & volatilty vs return, and time horizon based on Mrs Buffet's age.

# Data Sources used:
 - ETFdb.com for listings of ETFs from around the world which are traded in the USA.
 - yFinance for daily ETF close prices over the past decade.

# Data exploration & clean up process:
Daily close price data for 561 ETFs over a decade was obtained.  They had to be broken up into 30 smaller data requests and pulled into Jupyter Lab.
The cumulative returns were reviewed based on 4 time horizons: 1, 3, 5 and 10 year returns.  The top 20 ETFs for each of these time horizons were extracted, resulting in 51 ETFs.
The top 20 ETFs from each timeframe were given a score based on their rank, and an overall ranking obtained over the 4 time horizons.
From this process, a list of top 9 ETFs across all timeframes were selected.
The data was then amended so the top 9 ETFs were reviewed using a consistent start date (7.5 years history), so they could be consistently compared based on cumulative returns, standard deviation, sharpe ratio.

# Conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data).
